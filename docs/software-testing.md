# What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing** is the process of identifying the *correctness* and *quality* of software program. In other words, testing is executing a system or application in order to find software *bugs*, *defects* or *errors*. The purpose is to check whether the software satisfies the specific requirements, needs and expectations of the customer.

## Roles And Responsibilities Of A Tester
- Analyzing the SRS, System Requirement Specifications, and understanding the necessities
- Determining an estimation for the testing
- Preparing or understanding the test plan
- Putting together test cases
- Assembling test data
- Testing and finding defects in the software
- Reporting the defects immediately to make it easier for the developer to fix
- Testing again after the initial problem has been fixed
- Carrying out regression testing
- Offering suggestions for improving SDLC processes
- Delivering support to customers testing the software
- Partaking in the implementation of the software
- Providing support after the implementation is completed

## Types Of Testing

- **White Box Testing**: This type of testing requires the test to understand the software’ implementation and code. Then, they’ll attempt to analyze the logic of that code. In most cases, the developer will take part in white box testing.
- **Black Box Testing**: Black box testing looks at things from the end user’s perspective. This type of testing is carried out to determine how functional the software is and whether or not it is going to meet the client’s requirements. To ensure that this testing is carried out correctly, it is pertinent to make sure that the user does not know how the software is supposed to work internally.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: This type of testing is pretty straightforward. It is performed by the end user right before the product is actually released to the public. This is often done during the beta-testing stage. Be sure to get as many people involved in this testing as possible.
- **GUI Testing**: Finally, you’ll also want to take advantage of GUI testing. This will ensure that the look and feel of the software will satisfy the user. Again, it is pertinent to utilize all types of testing to ensure that the software is up to par.
- **End To End Testing**: End to end testing is another necessity. It is very similar to system testing, but there are a few differences. End to end testing will analyze the software from the starting line to the finish line to ensure that each area is working appropriately. During this phase, an environment that resembles a real time environment will be used. It is also pertinent to ensure that the software is syncing with the database correctly.
- **Regression Testing**: Regression testing should always be carried out after flaws and bugs have been corrected. This type of testing ensures that previous fixes were adequate and that they did not cause any further problems.
