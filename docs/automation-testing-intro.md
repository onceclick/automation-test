# What is Automation Testing?

**Automation testing** uses automation tools to write and execute test cases, no manual involvement is required while executing an automated test suite.

## Why Automation Testing is important?
- Do automation testing at the time of lots of regression work.
- Automate your testing work when GUI is same but you have lot of often functional changes.

## When to automate an application
- Requirements do not change frequently
- Access the application for load and performance with many virtual users
- Steady Software with respect to manual testing
- Obtainability of time
- Huge and serious projects
- Projects that need to test the same areas often

## Simple Steps to follow in Automation testing
- Identify areas within software to automate
- Choose the appropriate tool for test automation
- Write test scripts
- Develop test suits
- Execute test scripts
- Build result reports
- Find possible bugs or performance issue

## Benefits of Automation Testing
- Saves money
- Increases software quality
- Reduces testing time
- Support various applications
- Increase testing coverage
- Reduction of repetitive work
- Greater consistency

## Software testing tools Available in Automation Testing
- HP Quick Test Professional
- **Selenium**
- Visual Studio Test Professional
- WATIR
- IBM Rational Functional Tester
- TestComplete
- Testing Anywhere
- WinRunner
- LaodRunner
- SilkTest

## Risks involved in Automation testing
- Starting cost for Automation is very high
- Automation is not 100%
- Do not automate unfixed UI
- Is your application is constant sufficient to automate additional testing work
- Tester should have good programming knowledge

## Automation Testing vs Manual Testing 
Automation Testing | Manual Testing
--- | ---
Automation testing perform the same operation each time | Manual testing is not reliable. Using this method test execution is not accurate all the time.
Automation testing is very much helpful regressions in testing where code changes frequently. | To execute the test cases first time using manual testing will be very much useful. But it is not sure that it will catch the regression defects under frequently changing requirements.
Automation testing will be useful to execute the set of test cases frequently. | Manual testing will be useful when the test case only needs to run once or twice.
After making Automation test suites, fewer testers required to execute the test cases. | To execute the test cases every time tester requires the same amount of time.
Automation testing can also be done on different machine with different OS platform combination, concurrently. | Using manual testing,testing on different machine with different OS platform combination is not possible, concurrently. To execute such task different testers are required.
Using Automation testing, testers can test complicated application too. | It does not involve in programming task to fetch hidden information.
Automation runs test cases significantly faster than human resources. | Manual testing is slower than automation. Running tests manually can be very time consuming.
Some time it is not helpful in UI testing | It is very much helpful in UI testing
Automation testing is very useful for automating the Build Verification Testing (BVT) & it is not mundane and tiresome. | To execute the Build Verification Testing (BVT) is very mundane and tiresome in manual testing
Initial cost of automation testing is more than manual testing but useful always. | Manual testing requires less cost than automation.
