# What is Manual Testing ?
**Manual Testing** is a process of finding out the defects or bugs in a software program. 
- In this method the tester plays an important role of end user and verifies that all the features of the application are working correctly. 
- The tester manually executes test cases without using any automation tools. 
- The tester prepares a test plan document which describes the detailed and systematic approach to testing of software applications. 
- Test cases are planned to cover almost 100% of the software application. As manual testing involves complete test cases ***it is a time consuming test***.
- The differences between actual and desired results are treated as defects. The defects are then fixed by the developer of software application. 
- The tester retests the defects to ensure that defects are fixed. 
- The goal of Manual testing is to ensure that application is defect & error free and is working fine to provide good quality work to customers.
