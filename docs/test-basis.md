# What is Test Basis and How it is helps to build Test Cases?

Basis for the tests is called the Test Basis. It could be a system requirement, a technical specification, the code itself, or a business process. The test basis is the information needed in order to start the test analysis and create our Test Cases.

## Possible Test Basis are:
- System Requirement Document (SRS)
- Functional Design Specification
- Technical Design Specification
- User Manual
- Use Cases
- Source Code
- Business Requirement Document (BRD)
